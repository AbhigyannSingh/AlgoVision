# Sorting Visualizer

This Sorting Visualizer is built using React and provides a user-friendly interface to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It supports the following sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Selection Sort

## Features

- **Delay Control**: Adjust the delay to control the speed of the sorting visualization.
- **Generate Arrays**: Quickly generate new arrays of varying sizes to test the sorting algorithms.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Sorting Visualizer.

## Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### 2. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through each element in the array and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.

### 3. Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the array into smaller subarrays, recursively sorts them, and then merges them back together in the correct order.

### 4. Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two subarrays such that elements less than the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right. It then recursively sorts the subarrays.

### 5. Selection Sort
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the array.
